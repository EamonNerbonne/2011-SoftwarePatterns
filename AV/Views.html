<h1>Architectural Views</h1>
<h2>Logical view</h2>
<p>The logical view for the Mercurial describes the functionality of the Mercurial system to the end-users. 
Mercurial is a modern distributed version control system(VCS) which is written in Python. 
The main advantage of distributed VCS is that it allows developers to push around and intergrate changes as the project
requires at each point of time. The logical view of the Mercurial can be briefly discussed as follows:
The Mercurial architecture consists of a large number of modules.Each module has its own repository.
The user can clone the repository to code the module. The end user can use several clones.
Modules have their own unit tests. So code tests have to pass (i.e. yield only successes) before the user repositories to be pushed into the files. 
A build server then tests again each push, because problems may appear (e.g. platform-compatibility, or missing files).
When a module is ready, it is pushed into the testing repository. In this repository, the QA tests the modules. 
Developers may code in this repository (mainly to fix bugs), but they should not add new features to the code.
If the test is successful then the user releases it by pushing it into the stable repository.</p>

<h2>Development view</h2>
<p>The development view for the Mercurail deals mainly with the software development and management.
We can also find few bits in C because they are critical to the performance of the system. 
A Python module correspoonds to a single file of code. Modules are the basic organizers for the source code. 
Mercurial contains a package known as _init_.py which exposes all modules and packages to the Python importer.
It also has two default packages called the 'mercurial' and 'hgext'. 
The 'mercurial'package contains the core code required to run Mercurial whereas 'hgext' contains a lrage number of extensions.
Mercurial can be basically categorized as a Command-line application.
One of the powerful features of Mercurial is the ability to write the extensions.
It is quite simple and easy to extend Mercurial beacuse of Python. 
other feature of Mercurial is 'Hooks'which provide a way to the VCS events to interact with the outside world.
There are two variants of hooks one is the traditional hook which invokes scripts in the shell. 
The other one is the Python hook which invokes Python module and a function name to call from that module.
In Mercurial, hooks are divided into four types:
1) pre-command
2) post-command
3) controlling
4) miscellaneous
