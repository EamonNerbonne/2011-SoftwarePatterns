<tr>
<td>Problem</td>
<td>
<p>The Mercurial has to be designed with separation of concern, capability to extend, and independency of any major platform </p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Solution</td>
<td>
<p>The pattern chosen as solution is Relaxed layer. The separation of concern and extensibility are resolved by dividing Mercurial system into several modules and grouping them into some layers based on their level of abstraction. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Rationale</td>
<td>
<p> The advantage of choosing relaxed layer pattern is the separation of components into layers but still maintaining the flexibility among components of different layers, e.g. between top layer with bottom layer, to interact directly. The layers also enables developer or patch/extent developer to extend Mercurial features separately without interfering other components/layers. The separation of modules allows the system to be developed in different platforms. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Consequences</td>
<td>
<p>This pattern allows layers to interact without passing through any intermediate layer. This could make problem when a reference component in bottom layer changed, the developer must examine not only its upper layer but also any layers above which interact directly to it</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Related patterns</td>
<td>
<p>Interceptor pattern relates to relaxed layer in regards to the need to integrate the patch into Mercurial using hook mechanism.</p>
