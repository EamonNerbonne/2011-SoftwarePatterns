<td>Problem</td>
<td>
<p>The Mercurial has to be designed with separation of concerns, capability to extend, and platform independence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Solution</td>
<td>
<p>The pattern chosen as solution is Relaxed Layers. The capability to extend is resolved by dividing the system into components, so the developers can extend only a particular component. The separation of concerns is resolved by grouping components into layers based on their level of abstraction. This also enables to develop components for specific platforms. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Rationale</td>
<td>
<p> The advantage of relaxed layers pattern is the separation of components into layers but still maintaining the flexibility among components of different layer, e.g. between topmost layer with the bottom layer, to interact directly without any intermediate layer. This also enables developers to add patch in order to extend Mercurial features without interfering other components. Developer can also extend component for a specific platform.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Consequences</td>
<td>
<p> Since this pattern allows component to interact accross layers, the relations may become complicated. When a referenced component in bottom layer changes, the developer must ensure that all components not only in upper layer but also in every layers which refer to it work normally.  </p>

<td>Related patterns</td>
<td>
<p>Interceptor pattern. It relates to Relaxed Layers pattern in regards to integrate patch into the system using hook mechanism.</p>
