        <span>The document presents the pattern-based recovery and evaluation of the architecture
            of an open-source system, Mercurial. It is a distributed version control system.
            This document gives an overview of the patterns that represent the core of the Mercurial
            system. We use the IDAPO for identifying the architectural patterns in Open source
            software. We also discuss about the specific variants of the patterns which we chose.
            Furthermore we need to evaluate the found patterns using Pattern-Based Architectural
            Review method. the evaluation of the consequences of patterns is based on the system’s
            quality attributes. </span>
    </p>
    <p class=" c24">
        <span>The structure of the document is as follows: </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
        <span>Chapter 2 describes the system context of Mercurial version control system. Chapter
            3 deals with identifying the stakeholders and their concerns as well as the key
            drivers which should drive the development of the system. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
        <span>Chapter 4 describes the various architectural views for the system and also the
            architectural patterns identified for the Mercurial system using IDAPO. It also
            discusses how the various patterns are related with each other and the impact of
            each pattern on the system architecture and also &#160;discusses about the variants
            used . It also includes the decomposition of the patterns, responsibilities of each
            component in the patterns and also about the interfaces.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
        <span>Chapter 5 is mainly focused on the architectural evaluation of the Mercurial system
            using PBAR approach. It also shows how each quality attribute identified are addressed.

        <span>Mercurial </span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" name="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup> <span>is
            a distributed revision control system. It aims to help developers manage changes
            (revisions) made to projects. &#160;Managing multiple versions of even a single
            document by hand is an error-prone, time-consuming task. &#160;Mercurial allows
            a team of developers to manage large numbers of documents with many versions. &#160;Although
            mercurial can maintain a version history for arbitrary files and directories, it
            is designed in particular to deal well with large numbers of complex text documents
            such as source code. &#160;There are several ways in which mercurial helps address
            the problems arising from collaborating on such code.</span>
    </p>
    <h3>
        <a name="h.iiz1il7msuhf"></a><span>2.1 Mercurial’s functionality</span></h3>
    <p>
        <span class="c4  highlight">TODO: <i>relevant to explain source control in more detail
            than this?</i></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
        <span>Firstly, Mercurial maintains a log:</span> <span>&#160;an annotated history of
            changes</span> <span>. &#160;In addition to keeping track of the documents themselves,
                mercurial allows developers to keep track of which lines were changed, the date
                the changes were made, the identity of the author, and, importantly, the motivation
                for these changes. &#160;This is achieved by splitting changes into cohesive chunks
                call </span><span>changesets. When a developer commits a changeset, he adds it to Mercurial’s
                    repository of changesets, and includes a commit message describing what was changed
                    and why. &#160;Changesets with commit messages are common in revision control systems;
                    they allow developers to maintain systems that are too large or too old by reducing
                    the need to grasp the entirety of the system at once.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
        <span>Mercurial assists collaboration by allowing concurrent edits. &#160;When several
            people simultaneously change a set of files, their changes need to be merged into
            a final version. &#160;Revision control systems such as mercurial assist the user
            by largely automating this process: if only one author changes a file, his version
            simply replaces the old one. &#160;When multiple authors change a file in a format
            mercurial understand (such as plain text), changes to non-overlapping regions are
            automatically merged. &#160;Finally, where changes do conflict, they are reported,
            and the user can systematically compare the changes to resolve the conflict. &#160;Automatic
            merging and conflict detection helps allow multiple developers work on the same
            project by avoiding the friction of each developer keeping abreast of all changes.</span></p>
    <p class="c24">
        <span>Mercurial allows distributed development teams by allowing any developer to pull
            others’ changes or push his own to an external repository. &#160;Crucially, there
            is no technical need for a central repository nor for &ldquo;one true&rdquo; history,
            allowing for truly distributed development. &#160;In particular, each committed
            changeset is uniquely identifiable, allowing mercurial to avoid applying changes
            it has already seen, even if those changes depend on each other in non-trivial ways.
            &#160;Mercurial’s logged history is conceptually a directed acyclic graph. &#160;Thus
            when two versions are merged that (partially) share the same history, the shared
            part of the history is not duplicated.</span></p>
    <p class="c24">
        <span>These three features enable many useful scenarios. &#160;For instance, in a large
            system, development mistakes are made. &#160; &#160;Since it maintains a history
            of changes and the details of each changes, mercurial can revert a particular change
            e.g. to correct a mistake. &#160;Unlike a strictly linear process, such a reverted
            change does not require the user to redo all subsequent changes; instead, the reverted
            change is itself a new changeset that can be merged anywhere into the version history.</span>
