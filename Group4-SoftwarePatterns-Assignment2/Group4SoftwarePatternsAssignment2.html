                    The document presents the pattern-based recovery and evaluation of the architecture
                    of an open-source system, Mercurial. It is a distributed version control system.
                    This document gives an overview of the patterns that represent the core of the Mercurial
                    system. We use the IDAPO for identifying the architectural patterns in Open source
                    software. We also discuss about the specific variants of the patterns which we chose.
                    Furthermore we need to evaluate the found patterns using Pattern-Based Architectural
                    Review method. the evaluation of the consequences of patterns is based on the system’s
                    quality attributes.

                <p>
                    Chapter 2 describes the system context of Mercurial version control system. Chapter
                    3 deals with identifying the stakeholders and their concerns as well as the key
                    drivers which should drive the development of the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chapter 4 describes the various architectural views for the system and also the
                    architectural patterns identified for the Mercurial system using IDAPO. It also
                    discusses how the various patterns are related with each other and the impact of
                    each pattern on the system architecture and also discusses about the variants used
                    . It also includes the decomposition of the patterns, responsibilities of each component
                    in the patterns and also about the interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chapter 5 is mainly focused on the architectural evaluation of the Mercurial system
                    using PBAR approach. It also shows how each quality attribute identified are addressed.

                <p>
                    Mercurial<sup><a href="#merc_links" id="merc_links_ref">[a]</a></sup> is a distributed
                    revision control system. It aims to help developers manage changes (revisions) made
                    to projects. Managing multiple versions of even a single document by hand is an
                    error-prone, time-consuming task. Mercurial allows a team of developers to manage
                    large numbers of documents with many versions. Although mercurial can maintain a
                    version history for arbitrary files and directories, it is designed in particular
                    to deal well with large numbers of complex text documents such as source code. There
                    are several ways in which mercurial helps address the problems arising from collaborating
                    on such code.
                </p>
                <section>
                    <h1>
                        Mercurial’s functionality</h1>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, Mercurial maintains a log: an annotated history of changes. In addition
                        to keeping track of the documents themselves, mercurial allows developers to keep
                        track of which lines were changed, the date the changes were made, the identity
                        of the author, and, importantly, the motivation for these changes. This is achieved
                        by splitting changes into cohesive chunks call changesets. When a developer commits
                        a changeset, he adds it to Mercurial’s repository of changesets, and includes a
                        commit message describing what was changed and why. Changesets with commit messages
                        are common in revision control systems; they allow developers to maintain systems
                        that are too large or too old by reducing the need to grasp the entirety of the
                        system at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mercurial assists collaboration by allowing concurrent edits. When several people
                        simultaneously change a set of files, their changes need to be merged into a final
                        version. Revision control systems such as mercurial assist the user by largely automating
                        this process: if only one author changes a file, his version simply replaces the
                        old one. When multiple authors change a file in a format mercurial understands (such
                        as plain text), changes to non-overlapping regions are automatically merged. Finally,
                        where changes do conflict, they are reported, and the user can systematically compare
                        the changes to resolve the conflict. Automatic merging and conflict detection helps
                        allow multiple developers work on the same project by avoiding the friction of each
                        developer keeping abreast of all changes.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mercurial allows distributed development teams by allowing any developer to pull
                        others’ changes or push his own to an external repository. Crucially, there is no
                        technical need for a central repository nor for “one true” history, allowing for
                        truly distributed development. In particular, each committed changeset is uniquely
                        identifiable, allowing mercurial to avoid applying changes it has already seen,
                        even if those changes depend on each other in non-trivial ways. Mercurial’s logged
                        history is conceptually a directed acyclic graph. Thus when two versions are merged
                        that (partially) share the same history, the shared part of the history is not duplicated.</p>
                    <p>
                        These three features enable many useful scenarios. For instance, in a large system,
                        development mistakes are made. Since it maintains a history of changes and the details
                        of each changes, mercurial can revert a particular change e.g. to correct a mistake.
                        Unlike a strictly linear process, such a reverted change does not require the user
                        to redo all subsequent changes; instead, the reverted change is itself a new changeset
                        that can be merged anywhere into the version history.
