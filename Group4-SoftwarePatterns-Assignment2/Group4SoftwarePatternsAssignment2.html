                    The document presents the pattern-based recovery and evaluation of the architecture
                    of an open-source system, <a href="#bib-mercurial">Mercurial</a>. It is a distributed version control system.
                    This document gives an overview of the patterns that represent the core of the Mercurial
                    system. We use the IDAPO for identifying the architectural patterns in Open source
                    software. We also discuss about the specific variants of the patterns which we chose.
                    Furthermore we need to evaluate the found patterns using Pattern-Based Architectural
                    Review method. the evaluation of the consequences of patterns is based on the system’s
                    quality attributes.

                <p>
                    Mercurial<sup><a href="#merc_links" id="merc_links_ref">[a]</a></sup> is a distributed
                    revision control system. It aims to help developers manage changes (revisions) made
                    to projects. Managing multiple versions of even a single document by hand is an
                    error-prone, time-consuming task. Mercurial allows a team of developers to manage
                    large numbers of documents with many versions. Although mercurial can maintain a
                    version history for arbitrary files and directories, it is designed in particular
                    to deal well with large numbers of complex text documents such as source code. There
                    are several ways in which mercurial helps address the problems arising from collaborating
                    on such code.
                </p>
                <section>
                    <h1>
                        Mercurial’s functionality</h1>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, Mercurial maintains a log: an annotated history of changes. In addition
                        to keeping track of the documents themselves, mercurial allows developers to keep
                        track of which lines were changed, the date the changes were made, the identity
                        of the author, and, importantly, the motivation for these changes. This is achieved
                        by splitting changes into cohesive chunks call changesets. When a developer commits
                        a changeset, he adds it to Mercurial’s repository of changesets, and includes a
                        commit message describing what was changed and why. Changesets with commit messages
                        are common in revision control systems; they allow developers to maintain systems
                        that are too large or too old by reducing the need to grasp the entirety of the
                        system at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mercurial assists collaboration by allowing concurrent edits. When several people
                        simultaneously change a set of files, their changes need to be merged into a final
                        version. Revision control systems such as mercurial assist the user by largely automating
                        this process: if only one author changes a file, his version simply replaces the
                        old one. When multiple authors change a file in a format mercurial understands (such
                        as plain text), changes to non-overlapping regions are automatically merged. Finally,
                        where changes do conflict, they are reported, and the user can systematically compare
                        the changes to resolve the conflict. Automatic merging and conflict detection helps
                        allow multiple developers work on the same project by avoiding the friction of each
                        developer keeping abreast of all changes.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mercurial allows distributed development teams by allowing any developer to pull
                        others’ changes or push his own to an external repository. Crucially, there is no
                        technical need for a central repository nor for “one true” history, allowing for
                        truly distributed development. In particular, each committed changeset is uniquely
                        identifiable, allowing mercurial to avoid applying changes it has already seen,
                        even if those changes depend on each other in non-trivial ways. Mercurial’s logged
                        history is conceptually a directed acyclic graph. Thus when two versions are merged
                        that (partially) share the same history, the shared part of the history is not duplicated.</p>
                    <p>
                        These three features enable many useful scenarios. For instance, in a large system,
                        development mistakes are made. Since it maintains a history of changes and the details
                        of each changes, mercurial can revert a particular change e.g. to correct a mistake.
                        Unlike a strictly linear process, such a reverted change does not require the user
                        to redo all subsequent changes; instead, the reverted change is itself a new changeset
                        that can be merged anywhere into the version history.

                            Logical view</h1>
                        <p>
                            The logical view for the Mercurial describes the functionality of the Mercurial
                            system to the end-users. Mercurial is a modern distributed version control system(VCS)
                            which is written in Python. The main advantage of distributed VCS is that it allows
                            developers to push around and intergrate changes as the project requires at each
                            point of time. The logical view of the Mercurial can be briefly discussed as follows:
                            The Mercurial architecture consists of a large number of modules.Each module has
                            its own repository. The user can clone the repository to code the module. The end
                            user can use several clones. Modules have their own unit tests. So code tests have
                            to pass (i.e. yield only successes) before the user repositories to be pushed into
                            the files. A build server then tests again each push, because problems may appear
                            (e.g. platform-compatibility, or missing files). When a module is ready, it is pushed
                            into the testing repository. In this repository, the QA tests the modules. Developers
                            may code in this repository (mainly to fix bugs), but they should not add new features
                            to the code. If the test is successful then the user releases it by pushing it into
                            the stable repository.</p>

                            Development view</h1>
                        <p>
                            The development view for the Mercurail deals mainly with the software development
                            and management. We can also find few bits in C because they are critical to the
                            performance of the system. A Python module correspoonds to a single file of code.
                            Modules are the basic organizers for the source code. Mercurial contains a package
                            known as _init_.py which exposes all modules and packages to the Python importer.
                            It also has two default packages called the 'mercurial' and 'hgext'. The 'mercurial'package
                            contains the core code required to run Mercurial whereas 'hgext' contains a lrage
                            number of extensions. Mercurial can be basically categorized as a Command-line application.
                            One of the powerful features of Mercurial is the ability to write the extensions.
                            It is quite simple and easy to extend Mercurial beacuse of Python. other feature
                            of Mercurial is 'Hooks'which provide a way to the VCS events to interact with the
                            outside world. There are two variants of hooks one is the traditional hook which
                            invokes scripts in the shell. The other one is the Python hook which invokes Python
                            module and a function name to call from that module. In Mercurial, hooks are divided
                            into four types:
                        </p>

                            <li>controlling</li>
                            <li>miscellaneous</li>

                            Process view</h1>
                        <p>
                            The process view of Mercurial depicts the interaction of processes or objects in
                            runtime. When Mercurial tracks modifications to a file, it stores the history of
                            that file in a metadata object called a 'filelog'. Mercurial uses a structure called
                            a 'manifest' to collect together information about the files that it tracks. Each
                            entry in the manifest contains information about the files present in a single changeset.
                            The changelog contains information about each changeset. Within a changelog, a manifest,
                            or a filelog, each revision stores a pointer to its immediate parent (or to its
                            two parents, if it's a merge revision). For every changeset in a repository, there
                            is exactly one revision stored in the changelog. Each revision of the changelog
                            contains a pointer to a single revision of the manifest. A revision of the manifest
                            stores a pointer to a single revision of each filelog tracked when that changeset
                            was created. The underpinnings of changelogs, manifests, and filelogs are provided
                            by a single structure called the revlog. Mercurial only ever appends data to the
                            end of a revlog file. Mercurial treats every write as part of a transaction that
                            can span a number of files. A transaction is atomic: either the entire transaction
                            succeeds and its effects are all visible to readers in one go, or the whole thing
                            is undone. This guarantee of atomicity means that if user is running two copies
                            of Mercurial, where one is reading data and one is writing it, the reader will never
                            see a partially written result that might confuse it. In the working directory,
                            Mercurial stores a snapshot of the files from the repository as of a particular
                            changeset. When user updates the working directory to contain a particular changeset,
                            Mercurial looks up the appropriate revision of the manifest to find out which files
                            it was tracking at the time that changeset was committed, and which revision of
                            each file was then current. It then recreates a copy of each of those files, with
                            the same contents it had when the changeset was committed.</p>

                            The physical view depicts the system concerned with the topology of software components.
                            Since Mercurial can be seen as peer-to-peer application, each peer has the same
                            structure as the other. Each peer represents a node which contains some layers.
                            In general, no layer should know the details of any layer above it, and no layer
                            should abuse the interface of layers below it. Interface layer is the topmost layer
                            and is the part most directly exposed to the user. It contains commands.py, an implementation
                            of the command line interface which contains most of the code that deals with converting
                            commands into simple repository operations as well as the stdio push/pull interface,
                            and hgweb.py, an implementation of the web interface which contains all the web
                            and templating logic as well as the web based push/pull interface. The second one,
                            Repository layer contains all the objects that implement the core primitives of
                            the SCM such as commit, checkout/update/merge, push/pull, add/remove/copy, verify,
                            and the proxy objects for remote repositories (remoterepository, sshrepository,
                            httprepository, httpsrepository, statichttprepository) and the objects from which
                            the repository is constructed (filelog, manifest, changeset, dirstate). The third
                            one, Storage layer contains the basis for version storage, revlog. The fourth one,
                            UI layer provides generic methods for communicating with the user and managing configuration
                            info. The fifth layer, Utility layer includes generic functionality and platform
                            abstraction.

                                The revlog storage can be seen as an indirection layer over the filesystem: direct
                                access is problematic due to performance, corruption and locking.  <i>Rejected, Shared datastore is a better match</i></dd>

                                Active repository: the mercurial VCS itself can be seen as an active repository
                                in that it provides hooks that can actively notify others of changes. Is this more
                                like a feature than a pattern? It's also not major. <i>Accepted, Divya</i></dd>

                                The CLIENT-SERVER pattern consists of  two kinds of components: clients and servers. Both of them implement collective tasks: transaction and system management. 
The CLIENT-SERVER pattern builds complex system architectures by introducing
multiple client-server relationships: a server can act itself as a client to other servers. The
Client tier responsibles for the presentation of data, controlling users’ interface; It can be multiple users browsers. Whole data stores into backend tier
Backend tier stores the data .
