<tr>
<td>Problem</td>
<td>
<p>The Mercurial has been designed to enhance the communication speed between different components and eliminates dependency on a single physical machine.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Solution</td>
<td>
<p>The pattern chosen is peer-to-peer as in Mercurial each componenent acts a both client and server. In Mercurial, each component for example revlogs 
is a data structure which represents all the versions of a file.It is independent of other components like the dirstate which is also a data structure used to represent 
what is in the working directory. In these cases, each componenent is treated as a peer and the tasks are equally distributed and have equal responsibilities.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Rationale</td>
<td>
<p> The advantages of choosing peer-to-peer pattern is it enhances scalability and performance which satisfies our quality attributes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Consequences</td>
<td>
<p>This pattern eliminates the problem of SOP (Single Point of Failure). 
As each componenent acts as a peer, time of request and time of response is reduced. 
This inturn will increase the communication speed and also increases work productivity.</p>
