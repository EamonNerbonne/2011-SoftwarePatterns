Revision history:
- Eamon + Divya: 4 and 5
- all

Timesheet:
- all

Chapter 2:
- DONE: If we only have one section in chapter one, remove the subsection number. - Eamon

Chapter 3:
Stakeholders:
 - DONE: Adaptability to extensibility - Eamon
Key drivers:

- DONE: Add comments about the key drivers not having a priority (could be useful for us in the evaluation
if we need trade-off reasons for choosing one keydriver over another). - Sunna

Chapter 4:
- Add text under diagrams
Diagrams: http://www.google.nl/search?q=process+view&hl=en&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=HfAvT465M8OAhQfZ_M3PCg&ved=0CFAQsAQ&biw=1068&bih=533#hl=en&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=workflow+diagram+mercurial&pbx=1&oq=workflow+diagram+mercurial&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=73475l79013l0l79949l28l22l0l1l1l4l109l1340l20.1l21l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=af77e95bb5aa65a0&biw=1068&bih=490
Overview diagram:
- Add a reference to the diagram. - Edy
- Explain what the layers are and where they come from. - Link from page and the text from there - Edy

- DONE: Candidate patterns: Add a sentence that we followed IDAPO process and that this is step # in the process. - Sunna

Patterns: -  Pattern based
- DONE: Add sources and diagrams to all.
- Check that all templates are the same for the patterns.
- Proxy solution: Looks generic / not how it actually is in Mercurial. Example: used for different instances in Mercurial.
- Proxy: add together problem and context, solution and variant
- Shared datastore: add new diagram
- Interceptor: fix text -  refrace Rationale (first sentese) - Consequence: make code more maintainable (complicated) and
affects security.
- Relaxed Layer: fix text in Solution variant and add diagram

Chapter 5:
Evaluation: 
-  DONE: add color to plus/minus
Relaxed layers - give rationale about how it is actually in Mercurial. - Edy
Proxy - take out the neg in Usability - take out the text about performance (this way it does not exist) - Keep only 
Extensibility (with plus)
 DONE: P2P - make plus and minus (forget to push/pull) - text

Recommendations:
- Suggest new pattern/or different variant of existing if maybe one Key driver is not addressed in the existing ones.
- If many + and - in one pattern, suggest how that can be fixed (new or different variant of pattern).
- Something to make persistance, to automatically push/pull - improve reliability - Assel
- Integrate authentication - improves usability - Divya
- Shared datastore - change the implementation - Eamon
- DONE: Reorganization of Layer pattern - move UI layer - to make more conventional - Edy
