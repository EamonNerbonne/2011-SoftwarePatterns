<td>Problem</td>
<td>
<p>The Mercurial has been designed as a continuous integration system that builds and tests software automatically and regularly</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Solution</td>
<td>
<p>The pattern chosen is interceptor for Mercurial. Interceptor defines the signatures of the hook methods. Hook is a code which handles intercepted function calls,
messages and events. They provide a way for version control systems like Mercurial to interact with the outside world. In Mercurial, users can invoke Python hooks by
specifying a Python module and a function name to call from that module.The Mercurial framework facilitates the registration of interceptors through dispatchers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Rationale</td>
<td>
<p> The advantages of choosing interceptor pattern is they are associated with a particular set of events. Concrete interceptors specialize interceptor interfaces
and implement the hook methods of Mercurial to handle events in an application-specific manner. In Mercurial, we have four types of hooks, pre-command, post-command,
controlling and miscellaneous. Pre-command and post-command hooks can be trivially defined for any command by specifying a pre-command or post-command key. The controlling and 
miscellaneous hooks have predefined set of events.</p>

</tr>
<td>Consequences</td>
<td>
<p>This pattern includes strict seperation of framework and interceptors allows independent variation and evolution of service extensions in Mercurial  </p>
</td>

<td>Related patterns</td>
<td>
<p>Interceptor proxy (Delegator) pattern is a variant of interceptor pattern. This pattern is used on the server-side of a distributed system to intercept 
remote operations.</p>
